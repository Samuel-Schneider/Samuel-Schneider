        <h3>Job information</h3>
        <p>Unfortunately, I've never actually had a proper job in the animation of voice acting field, really I've only<br>
        ever done a few online skits or standalone pieces, so I can't give much information at the moment.</p>
        <h3>Educational experience in the industry</h3>
        <p>Due to my lack of experience, I can't say much, but I do however have a quote from someone who IS in the industry, and I have talked with them about the animation industry before.</p>

            I get to wake up every-day looking forward to my job! Each day presents itself with a set of challenges, and each day I go home learning something new. Itâ€™s an amazing feeling when the audience reacts positively to your hard work!
